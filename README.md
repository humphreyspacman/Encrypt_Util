Usage:
        For single file encryption:
                simple_crypt.py -c encrypt -p pathname
        For multiple file encryption(directory):
                simple_crypt.py -c encrypt_dir -p pathname(should be an existing directory)
        For single encrypted file decryption:
                simple_crypt.py -c decrypt -p pathname
        For multiple (encrypted)file decryption(directory):
                simple_crypt.py -c decrypt_dir -p pathname(should be an existing directory that starts with (encrypted))
